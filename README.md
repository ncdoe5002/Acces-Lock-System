🔐 Unity Lock System
A simple and customizable lock mechanism built in Unity—great for puzzles, safes, escape rooms, or anything that needs a code input to unlock.

📁 Project Overview
This Unity project demonstrates a basic lock system, where players must input a correct code (through dials, a keypad, or rotating elements) to unlock something in the game.

✨ Features
🔢 Code-based unlocking

🎮 Player interaction via UI or 3D elements

🧩 Modular and easy to customize

📦 Clean C# scripts for reuse

🔓 Triggers actions when unlocked

🛠️ How It Works
The system checks the player's input against a predefined code. Once the correct code is entered, it triggers an event that you can hook up to any in-game action (e.g., open a door, play a sound, activate an animation).

🔧 Main Components
LockManager.cs: Handles the logic for checking input

Dial.cs or KeypadInput.cs: Handles player input

Unity Events: Triggered on successful unlock
